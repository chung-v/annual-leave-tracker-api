## R1 Explain the problem that this app will solve, and explain how this app solves or addresses the problem.
This Annual Leave Tracker API addresses significant challenges in managing employee leave in workplaces that rely on interdepartmental collaboration. Poor coordination of leave schedules can disrupt workflows and delay critical tasks, while a lack of visibility into colleagues' planned absences complicates project management. Many organisations still depend on manual processes like spreadsheets, which are prone to errors and lack real-time access to leave data. Additionally, manual approval systems often create bottlenecks, delaying important decisions and disrupting operations.

This API solves these issues by offering real-time visibility into approved leaves, facilitating better coordination across departments. With role-based access control, only authorised admin users can approve, modify or remove leave requests, which helps maintain data integrity. By centralising leave information, the API enables managers to make informed decisions and plan effectively around team availability, thus minimising disruptions to project timelines and enhancing overall efficiency.

## R2 Describe the way tasks are allocated and tracked in your project.
Trello was employed for project planning and task management. Each task featured a checklist to guarantee that all elements of the project were addressed. Tasks were prioritised depending on the significance of the files necessary to operate the application.

## R4 Explain the benefits and drawbacks of this appâ€™s underlying database system.
PostgreSQL is used as the database system for this API. The advantages of using PostgreSQL include its adherence to ACID principles, which ensure the integrity, consistency, and reliability of transactions. This system also employs Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC), allowing multiple transactions to occur simultaneously without locking the data, thus preventing conflicts and enhancing performance. PostgreSQL's extensibility permits users to create custom data types, operators, and functions, catering to specific project needs. Furthermore, it benefits from an active community that contributes to comprehensive documentation and regular updates, providing ongoing support.

Despite its strengths, PostgreSQL does have some drawbacks. It can be memory and CPU-intensive, which may lead to performance issues as data volume and complexity increase. The setup and configuration process can be intricate, especially for those looking to leverage its advanced capabilities, resulting in a steeper learning curve for beginners. Being an open-source database, there may be inconsistencies in user-friendly features or interfaces due to contributions from various communities, potentially leading to compatibility issues that require specific software or hardware.

## R5 Explain the features, purpose and functionalities of the object-relational mapping system (ORM) used in this app.
### Purpose and Functionalities
This application was built using SQLAlchemy as the Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) system. It bridges the gap between Python application code and relational databases, fostering a clearer coding approach for developers by interacting with the database using Python objects instead of raw SQL queries. SQLAlchemy simplifies interactions with the database and enhances code readability and maintainability.

### Features
**Models**: SQLAlchemy allows the definition of models where database tables like `Employee` are represented as Python classes. Each class attribute corresponds to a column in the database table, making it easy to define the structure of your data and its types. This provides a clear and structured way to interact with the database.

    class Employee(db.Model):
    __tablename__ = "employee"

    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
    first_name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    last_name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
    email = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)
    password = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
    team_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('team.id'), nullable=False)
    is_admin = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)

**Relationships**: SQLAlchemy simplifies handling relationships between tables by allowing the user to define relationships directly in their models. This enables easy access to related data, making it intuitive to navigate between entities. In the below example, the relationship between `Employee` and `Team` is established through a foreign key, allowing you to fetch all employees belonging to a specific team without writing complex join queries.

    team = db.relationship('Team', back_populates='employees')

**Foreign Keys**: Foreign keys are used to define the relationships between different entities, enhancing data integrity and relational organisation. By using foreign keys, SQLAlchemy ensures that the relationships between tables are maintained correctly, preventing orphaned records and maintaining referential integrity. This is crucial for data consistency in a relational database.

    team_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('team.id'), nullable=False)

**CRUD Operations**: SQLAlchemy provides a straightforward way to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on your database. This allows developers to interact with the database easily without having to write complex SQL queries.

    # View a list of all departments
    @department_bp.route("/list", methods=['GET'])
    @jwt_required()
    def get_all_departments():
        stmt = db.select(Department).order_by(Department.department_name.asc())
        departments = db.session.scalars(stmt)
        return departments_schema.dump(departments), 200

**Querying**: SQLAlchemy enables robust querying capabilities to retrieve all entries or filter results based on specific conditions. This makes it simple to fetch data according to the needs of the application, whether you are looking for a single record or a list of records that match certain criteria.

    # Fetch leave requests with the "pending" status
    pending_status = db.session.query(Status).filter(Status.status_name == "pending").first()

**Schema Validation**: SQLAlchemy enforces data integrity through schema validation, using column constraints like `NOT NULL` and `UNIQUE`. These constraints ensure that valid data is entered into the database, preventing issues related to invalid or duplicate entries.

    email = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)  # Ensures email is unique and not null

## R6 Design an entity relationship diagram (ERD) for this appâ€™s database, and explain how the relations between the diagrammed models will aid the database design. This should focus on the database design BEFORE coding has begun, eg. during the project planning or design phase.

![Annual Leave Tracker ERD](/doc/ERD.png)

The ERD outlines a normalised database design for an employee leave tracking system, comprising five key entities: `Employee`, `LeaveRequest`, `Status`, `Team`, and `Department`. These relationships are designed in Third Normal Form (3NF), ensuring that data is well-structured and efficiently managed. Each entity focuses on a specific concept, like employees or teams, with foreign keys linking them together. This normalisation prevents data redundancy by storing information such as team names or status labels in separate tables and referencing them through foreign keys. For example, `LeaveRequest` links to `Status` through `status_id` to avoid repeating status names in every leave request.

The use of foreign key relationships between these models enforces data integrity and ensures consistency across the database. Relationships such as `Employee-LeaveRequest` and `Team-Employee` guarantee that employees belong to valid teams and that leave requests are associated with legitimate employees, improving data accuracy. The design also allows for efficient data retrieval through SQL joins, enabling fast queries across tables, such as fetching all leave requests for a particular team or department.

The structured relationships between the models in the ERD enhance the database design by ensuring data integrity, reducing redundancy, improving query performance, and facilitating maintainability. By implementing a clear, normalised design, the database becomes more scalable, easier to extend, and better equipped to handle complex queries and business logic while maintaining efficiency and consistency.

## R7 Explain the implemented models and their relationships, including how the relationships aid the database implementation. This should focus on the database implementation AFTER coding has begun, eg. during the project development phase.
The implemented models in the project include `Employee`, `LeaveRequest`, `Status`, `Team`, and `Department`, each representing a table in the database. The relationships between these models follow typical one-to-many and many-to-one patterns to efficiently manage the application's data.

**Employee Model**: Stores employee details, such as `first_name`, `email`, and a foreign key `team_id` linking to the `Team` model. This establishes a many-to-one relationship, where multiple employees can belong to one team.

    class Employee(db.Model):
        # Name of the table
        __tablename__ = "employee"

        # Attributes of the table
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        first_name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
        last_name = db.Column(db.String(50), nullable=False)
        email = db.Column(db.String(100), unique=True, nullable=False)
        password = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False)
        team_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('team.id'), nullable=False)
        is_admin = db.Column(db.Boolean, default=False)

        # Relationships
        team = db.relationship('Team', back_populates='employees')
        leave_requests = db.relationship('LeaveRequest', back_populates='employee')

**LeaveRequest Model**: Captures the details of leave requests, including `employee_id` (foreign key to `Employee`), `status_id` (foreign key to `Status`), and start and end dates. The many-to-one relationship with `Employee` ensures each leave request is associated with a specific employee, while the relationship with `Status` tracks the current state of the leave request.

    class LeaveRequest(db.Model):
        # Name of the table
        __tablename__ = "leave_request"

        # Attributes of the table
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        employee_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('employee.id'), nullable=False)
        start_date = db.Column(db.Date, nullable=False)
        end_date = db.Column(db.Date, nullable=False)
        status_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('status.id'), nullable=False)

        employee = db.relationship('Employee', back_populates='leave_requests')
        status = db.relationship('Status', back_populates='leave_requests')

**Team and Department Models**: A many-to-one relationship between `Team` and `Department` ensures that each team is linked to a specific department, allowing for organised data retrieval and reporting.

    class Team(db.Model):
        # Name of the table
        __tablename__ = "team"

        # Attributes of the table
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        team_name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False, unique=True)
        department_id = db.Column(db.Integer, db.ForeignKey('department.id'), nullable=False)

        # Relationships
        employees = db.relationship('Employee', back_populates='team')
        department = db.relationship('Department', back_populates='teams')

    class Department(db.Model):
        # Name of the table
        __tablename__ = "department"

        # Attributes of the table
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        department_name = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False, unique=True)

        # Relationships
        teams = db.relationship('Team', back_populates='department')

**Status Model**: Defines different statuses for leave requests (e.g. pending, approved), linked through a foreign key in `LeaveRequest`. This allows the system to manage leave request workflows by updating status IDs.

    class Status(db.Model):
        # Name of the table
        __tablename__ = "status"

        # Attributes of the table
        id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
        status_name = db.Column(db.String, nullable=False, unique=True)

        # Relationships
        leave_requests = db.relationship('LeaveRequest', back_populates='status')
